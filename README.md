# Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse

This project allows you to control your computer's mouse cursor using hand gestures, leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. It tracks hand landmarks to move the cursor, perform clicks, and even drag windows, all using simple hand movements.

## Features

- **Cursor Movement**: Move the mouse cursor based on the position of your index finger.
- **Left Click**: Perform a left-click when both the index and middle fingers are raised.
- **Drag and Drop**: Hold down the mouse button by pinching your thumb and index finger together.
- **Smooth Movement**: The cursor movement is smoothed to create a more natural interaction.
